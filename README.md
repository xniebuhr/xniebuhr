## Xander Niebuhr User Guide

### About Me
Hi, my name is Xander. I'm a Sophomore at the University of Nebraska - Omaha studying Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering and a minor in Cybersecurity. I'm active in Nullify, our school's cybersecurity club, and I'm a captain on our Esports team. I love to make coding projects, do cybersecurity challenges, and hang out with my friends in my free time. I also am very passionate about music; I've played viola, piano, and sang for over a decade each, and I love to make my own music projects and play for events. 

### Work Style
As all good computer scientists do, I approach tasks by breaking them into small pieces. I find completing 1000 small tasks to be much easier to do than making a few big tasks. Time management is also very important to me. I keep a sheet of exactly what I need to get done, exactly when I need it done. I might sometimes struggle on starting a certain task, but once I get going nothing can stop me. I prefer to work for long periods of time so I can stay locked in, so you will likely catch me working when I have plenty of time on my hands. 

### Collaboration Style
I almost exclusively like to interact in person. If I'm not in person, I won't be mad about an email or call, but I like to keep my work time for work and my other time for other activities. I also find in-person communication to be much more effective and easy comopared to emails or messages. I'm always open to collaboration and prefer to work with others whenever possible to get feedback and be able to keep up with and help others in their endeavors. 

### Values
I love to learn, and I'm motivated by trying out and learning new things.

### Feedback & Recognition 
I live off of feedback. I will almost never take anything someone says personally, and I would much rather know what I need to change than do something wrong or incorrectly without knowing. Whenever I get feedback on something, I will do my best to fix the problem and improve. 
In all my years of working, I've only ever had a conflict with one person, which was quickly resolved. I'm pretty laid back, and problems will almost never arise as long as communication is clear.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths: I love to learn, so give me a new technology and I will do my best to learn it. 
Weaknesses: I find it hard to start tasks without context, so if you need me to do something, be clear about what you need done.
