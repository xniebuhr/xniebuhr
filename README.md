# Xander Niebuhr User Guide

### About Me
Hi, my name is Xander. I'm a Sophomore at the University of Nebraska Omaha studying Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering and a minor in Cybersecurity. I'm active in Nullify, our school's cybersecurity club, and I'm a captain on our Esports team. I love to code and make coding projects, do cybersecurity challenges, and hang out with my friends in my free time. I also am very passionate about music - I've played viola, piano, and sung for over a decade each, and I love to make my own music projects and play for events. I'm also a video game addict, but I don't get much time to play in my busy schedule.

### Work Style
As all good computer scientists do, I approach tasks by breaking them into small pieces. I find completing 1000 small tasks to be much easier to do than completing a few big tasks. Time management is also very important to me. I keep a detailed list of exactly what I need to get done, exactly when I need it done, and if I say that I will do something, you better believe I will. I might sometimes struggle on starting a certain task, but once I get going nothing can stop me. I prefer long focused sessions when I have plenty of time on my hands and can formulate a way to break down and assign tasks. 

### Collaboration Style
I almost exclusively like to interact in person. If I'm not in person, I won't be mad about an email or call, but I like to keep my work time and free time separate. I also find in-person communication to be much more effective and easy compared to messages or calls. I'm always open to collaboration and prefer to work with others whenever possible to get feedback and be able to keep up with and help others in their endeavors. 
If I'm deeply focused on a task, I prefer not to be bothered, but feel free to approach me at any time to ask a question or talk!

### Values
I love to learn, and I'm motivated by trying out and learning new things.

### Feedback & Recognition 
I live off of feedback. I prefer direct feedback, and I like it as clear as possible. I will almost never take anything someone says personally, and I would much rather know what I need to change than do something wrong or incorrectly without knowing. Whenever I get feedback on something, I will do my best to fix the problem and improve. Don't worry about hurting my feelings - unless you are literally yelling at me, I won't ever be upset over feedback.
In all my years of working, I've only ever had a conflict with one person, which was quickly resolved. I'm pretty laid back, and problems will almost never arise as long as our communication is clear.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths: I love to learn, so give me a new technology or concept and I will do my best to learn it. 
Weaknesses: I find it hard to start tasks without a clear starting point or goal, so if you need me to do something, be clear about all aspects of what you need done.

I might seem shy or quiet when you first meet me, but once I get to know you, I am an absolute chatterbox. 

### Things I don't have patience for

* Whenever possible, try not to change things at the last minute
